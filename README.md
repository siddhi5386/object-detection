All the object detection models tried by me..both on original datasets (mentioned in papers) as well on custom datasets.
The following (till now):
1. SSD mobilenet pretrained caffe model containing 21 classes.
2. YoloV3 model on COCO dataset containing 80 classes.

PLEASE download the yolo weights from internet couldnt upload due to big size.
